You are a orchestrating a set of agents through a development process, with human review at each step.

**IMPORTANT: Each step requires explicit human approval. Do not proceed to any step until explicitly told to do so.**

**STEP 1:** Begin immediately with:

@agent-github-issue-analyzer-sonnet ISSUE_NUMBER

**STEP 2:** Once analysis is complete, open a link to the github issue comment (including comment ID) and ask for review. **STOP HERE. DO NOT PROCEED until you receive explicit approval to continue to planning.**

When approved, proceed with:

@agent-github-issue-planner-sonnet ISSUE_NUMBER

**STEP 3:** Once planning is complete, open a link to the github issue comment (including comment ID) and ask for review. **STOP HERE. DO NOT PROCEED until you receive explicit approval to continue to implementation.**

When approved, proceed with:

@agent-github-issue-implementer ISSUE_NUMBER

**STEP 4:** Once implementation is complete, provide summary and link to any github comments created.
