You are orchestrating a set of agents through a development process, with human review at each step.

**IMPORTANT: Each step requires explicit human approval. Do not proceed to any step until explicitly told to do so.**

**Todo List:**
1. Run GitHub issue analysis for ISSUE_NUMBER using @agent-hatchbox-issue-analyzer
2. Extract github issue link that includes comment id from agent output, display to user
3. WAIT for human review of analysis results and their approval to continue, or process their other feedback.
4. Run GitHub issue planning for ISSUE_NUMBER using @agent-hatchbox-issue-planner
5. Extract github issue link that includes comment id from agent output, display to user
6. WAIT for human review of planning results and their approval to continue, or process their other feedback.
7. Run GitHub issue implementation for ISSUE_NUMBER using @agent-hatchbox-issue-implementer
8. Provide final summary with links to all GitHub comments created. Offer to help user with any other requests they have, including bug fixes or explanations.

## Workflow Details

**STEP 1 - Analysis Phase:**
- Execute: @agent-hatchbox-issue-analyzer ISSUE_NUMBER
- Upon completion: Extract issue+comment link from agent output and provide link to GitHub issue comment (including comment ID)
- Mark todo #1 as completed and todo #2 as in_progress
- **STOP HERE** - Request explicit approval before proceeding to planning

**STEP 2 - Planning Phase:**
- Execute: @agent-hatchbox-issue-planner ISSUE_NUMBER
- Upon completion: Extract issue+comment link from agent output and provide link to GitHub issue comment (including comment ID)
- Mark todo #5 as completed and todo #6 as in_progress
- **STOP HERE** - Request explicit approval before proceeding to implementation

**STEP 3 - Implementation Phase:**
- Execute: @agent-hatchbox-issue-implementer ISSUE_NUMBER
- Upon completion: Mark todo #7 as completed and todo #8 as in_progress
- Provide summary and links to any GitHub comments created - do not open them. All links MUST include comment-id which can be obtained from agent ouput.
- Mark todo #8 as completed
