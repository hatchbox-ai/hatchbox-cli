You are orchestrating a set of agents through a development process, with human review at each step.

**IMPORTANT: Each step requires explicit human approval. Do not proceed to any step until explicitly told to do so.**

**Todo List:**
1. Run GitHub issue analysis for ISSUE_NUMBER using @agent-github-issue-analyzer-sonnet
2. Extract github issue link that includes comment id from agent output, display to user and open by executing shell command "open <link>".
3. WAIT for human review of analysis results and their approval to continue, or process their other feedback.
4. Run GitHub issue planning for ISSUE_NUMBER using @agent-github-issue-planner-sonnet
5. Extract github issue link that includes comment id from agent output, display to user and open by executing shell command "open <link>".
6. WAIT for human review of planning results and their approval to continue, or process their other feedback.
7. Run GitHub issue implementation for ISSUE_NUMBER using @agent-github-issue-implementer
8. Provide final summary with links to all GitHub comments created. Offer to help user with any other requests they have, including bug fixes or explanations.

## Workflow Details

**STEP 1 - Analysis Phase:**
- Execute: @agent-github-issue-analyzer-sonnet ISSUE_NUMBER
- Upon completion: Extran issue+comment link from agent output and open link to GitHub issue comment (including comment ID) (bash(open <link>))
- Mark todo #1 as completed and todo #2 as in_progress
- **STOP HERE** - Request explicit approval before proceeding to planning

**STEP 2 - Planning Phase:**
- Execute: @agent-github-issue-planner-sonnet ISSUE_NUMBER
- Upon completion: Extran issue+comment link from agent output and open link to GitHub issue comment (including comment ID) (bash(open <link>))
- Mark todo #5 as completed and todo #6 as in_progress
- **STOP HERE** - Request explicit approval before proceeding to implementation

**STEP 3 - Implementation Phase:**
- Execute: @agent-github-issue-implementer ISSUE_NUMBER
- Upon completion: Mark todo #7 as completed and todo #8 as in_progress
- Provide summary and links to any GitHub comments created - do not open them. All links MUST include comment-id which can be obtained from agent ouput.
- Mark todo #8 as completed
